  My coding experience this past week was, if I had to describe it in one word, intense. I spent a few hours on the dailies in the windowless computer lab in the English department considering the logistics of drawing a windshield and steering wheel onto a car with [Diana](http://dianarosenberger.github.io/) and [Aden](http://adenj86.github.io/). Later that night, I downloaded GitHub Desktop and Atom onto my laptop so that I could blog and code at home on my couch. There I ran into one of the recurring problems I'm in the process of figuring out how to tackle. I had trouble remembering the flow from one task and system to the next, due to the crippling duo of factors: a) I lack familiarity with the systems, topics, and terms, and b) it's weird/hard to take notes on coding! Once I got the friendly GitHub and Atom icons loaded snuggled onto my desktop and typed my blog responses into a Microsoft Word document, I saw that the GitHub website was down. **Commence Panic!!**
  
  Happily, I was eventually able to post both the reading and coding entries to my blog and sleep soundly. Also happily, we went over the GitHub workflow in depth in lab, and I did my best to take clear, comprehensive notes so that the next time I opened up the laptop, I would theoretically spend less time frozen, horrified, at my lack of recall.
  
  Speaking of that lab, I have to admit that I was a little bit zombified by the end, having arrived early for the open hours at 4:30pm. I plan to do it again tomorrow, though, because when it came time for lab at 8, I found myself able to dive right in to the subject matter and head space instead of spending 5-10 precious minutes restarting my computer and refreshing my memory on the various locations of instructions, finished dailies, notes, etc. I call that some serious progress.
