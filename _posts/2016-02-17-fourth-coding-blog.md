First of all, the bubbles we learned to code this week make me wish it was allowed/appropriate to bring mini bottles of champagne to lab for the whole class. I can picture how snazzy we would all look, toasting one another when we successfully got the bubbles to stop collecting at the tops of our screens.

But alas, I’m pretty sure open beverages aren’t allowed in computer classrooms and there is a University policy prohibiting alcohol in class, so I will carry on with the blog and leave that pipe dream behind now.
I just read [David’s](http://davidlnowak.github.io/blog/2016-02-17/post-week5-coding.html) blog about the fifth daily of the week, which requires us to animate some other shape besides the bubbles or the OG (oo)balls. Like David, I also had the pleasure of viewing [Nathaniel’s](http://nattybee.github.io/index.html) animation at the end of lab last week (and somehow, even though it was literally a video of a disembodied rear-end pooping, I am not being sarcastic in calling it a pleasure). Now I want to see David’s Shakespeare cube—it sounds awesome.

I had no intention of attempting anything grandiose for my own daily #5. I added hubcaps and a windshield to my car early in the semester, but I didn’t mess around with colors or a road. I’m not intrepid enough or competent enough of a coder to go for it to such an extent.

Don’t draw bubbles or balls? No problem. I went through my mental catalogue of the coding techniques I had stocked up in the first several weeks of labs and decided the rectangle would be my friend. I revised to a square, for balance.

Don’t animate in a floating or bouncing manner? Understood. I took away the upward motion so as not to tempt myself with something too float-y. I played around with the random function, making it more extreme. And that’s when I knew what my animation would be.
I made the square tiny. I made 10,000 of them. I made them white and left the background black. I saved and opened the Index file again in Chrome. Voila! A throwback to that classic American piece of media: the static-y TV set.
